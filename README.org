* Popup Buffers

A hacked together minor-mode to handle annoying popups in  Emacs. Only works well
in conjunction  with some system to  handle window creation and  placement, like
=shackle.el=. This plugin  summons windows  defined by  the user  as "popups"  by
simply calling =display-buffer=.

Pre-designate any buffer (by name or major-mode) as a popup, and it will stay out of your way.  Dismiss and summon it easily with one key. Useful for many things, including bringing up shells:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popup-buffers-toggle-latest.gif]]

Or you can cycle through all your popups:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popup-buffers-cycle.gif]]

Demote a regular window to popup status:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popup-buffers-demote.gif]]

Toggle all your popups:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
[[file:images/popup-buffers-toggle-all.gif]]

Or promote a popup to regular window (currently borked).
* Customization
There is only one variable to customize at the moment:

- =popup-buffers-reference-buffers=: List of buffers to treat as popups. Each entry in the list can be a regexp (string) to match buffer names against, or a major-mode (symbol) to match buffer major-modes against.

  Example: 

  ~'("\\\*Messages\\\*" "Output\\\*$" help-mode compilation-mode)~

  Will treat these as popups: The Messages buffer, any buffer ending in "Output*", and all help and compilation buffers.
* Setup (with =use-package=)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package popup-buffers
      :bind (("C-`" . popup-buffers-toggle-latest)
             ("M-`" . popup-buffers-cycle))
      :init
      (setq popup-buffers-reference-buffers
            '("\\*Messages\\*"
              "Output\\*$"
              help-mode
              compilation-mode))

      (popup-buffers-mode +1))
#+END_SRC
